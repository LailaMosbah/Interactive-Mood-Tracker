Tough times never last, but tough people do — Robert H. Schuller
Every storm runs out of rain — Maya Angelou
This too shall pass
Even the darkest night will end, and the sun will rise — Victor Hugo
Sometimes, we must break before we shine
Stars can’t shine without darkness
Pain is temporary, but growth is permanent
Sadness is just a chapter, not your whole story
The best view comes after the hardest climb
You are stronger than your struggles
Courage doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it’s the quiet voice saying, I will try again tomorrow
One day, you’ll look back and realize how far you’ve come
Cry if you must, but don’t quit
Sunshine follows the rain; joy follows the pain
The wound is where the light enters you — Rumi
Keep holding on, better days are coming
You’ve survived 100% of your worst days
Healing takes time, and that’s okay
Even in sadness, there is beauty in growth
You are not alone in this
Find the strength to rise even when you feel broken
Let your sadness teach you, not define you
Turn pain into power
Every setback is a setup for a comeback
Let yourself rest, but never give up
Tears water the seeds of resilience—rise stronger from every sorrow
In the quiet of loss, find the courage to rebuild your dreams
Shadows fade when you step forward; sadness is just a chapter, not the end
Hold tight to hope—grief carves the depth for your future strength
Every ache is a lesson; let it teach you to soar above the pain
Sorrow is a storm—stand firm, for clear skies await your resolve
From the ashes of sadness, forge a heart unbreakable and bold
A single tear fuels your fight—turn it into a river of purpose
Embrace the gray days; they sharpen your vision for brighter ones
Loss bends but doesn’t break you—rise as the hero of your story
Sadness builds your roots; grow tall through every trial
Tears cleanse the soul—emerge renewed and fierce
Grief is your teacher—learn its lessons and conquer all
The weight of sorrow lifts when you choose to climb
In darkness, find your light—sadness fuels your dawn
Every pang of loss is a call to rise higher than before
Sorrow shapes your steel—wield it as your strength
A heavy heart still beats—let it drum your victory march
Sadness is a forge; craft your resilience within it
From every fall, rise with wisdom only tears can give
